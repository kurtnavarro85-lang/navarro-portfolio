Creating my GitHub portfolio site was both a technical challenge and a rewarding learning experience. One of the main difficulties I faced was setting up GitHub Pages for the first time. At first, I wasn’t sure which branch or folder to use, but after exploring the repository settings and checking GitHub’s documentation, I was able to correctly configure the deployment from the main branch. Another challenge was ensuring that my portfolio site was responsive across devices. Initially, my layout worked fine on desktop but broke on mobile. To solve this, I used media queries in my CSS, applied flexible grid layouts, and tested using the browser’s responsive design mode until it displayed properly on smaller screens.

‎I also learned the importance of applying UI/UX design principles. For example, I used a clear visual hierarchy by making section headings bold and distinct, and I maintained consistent spacing with containers to avoid clutter. I made navigation simple by keeping a top menu with clear labels, and I used accessible design features like alt text on images and sufficient color contrast to improve readability.

‎If I were to improve the portfolio next, I would add more interactive features such as a contact form with email integration, as well as expand the projects section to showcase future work. I also plan to refine the overall styling with a more polished theme. Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in version control, deployment, and web design that I can use for future academic and professional projects.
